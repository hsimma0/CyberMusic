### FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
#### I want to be able to connect with others in more of niche way.For instance, filtering following base by genre, artist, venues. Also, I am going to create an instragram prototype around it, creating functions such as like, comment and search for users, follow and unfollow. I want to be able to incorporate music api which will allow users to listen to music and create a communal playlist on the app.I would like to have the ability to incorporate google maps api to enable users to save venues and help them plan their trips there.I want to implement a way where users can customize their profile (decorate it) to their own preference.
